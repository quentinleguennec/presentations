	A/B testing is widely used for apps or website. For example if you have a website and you want to improve your users experience, you create a second version of the website with only slight variations, like change the position of a button for example. Then you secretly divert part of your users to use this new version, and you see which group had the best experience. For example if they are suppose to click on the button see which group had the most clicks.
	And you can iterate from there.
